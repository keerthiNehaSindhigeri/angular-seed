This repository contains two main parts:

## 1. Native Web App (web-app-native)
- Located in the **`web-app-native`** folder.
- Built using basic **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** without any frameworks.
- Ideal for quick static websites or simple prototypes.

### How to use
- Navigate to the `web-app-native` folder.
- Open `request_occupancy_report.html` in a browser to run the app.
- Modify the HTML, CSS, and JS files to customize.

## 2. Angular Project (src/app/)

### Building
